## What Breaks Our Systems: A Taxonomy of Black Swans

Black swan events: unforeseen, unanticipated, and catastrophic issues. These are the incidents that take our systems down, hard, and keep them down for a long time.

By definition, you cannot predict true black swans. But black swans often fall into certain categories that we've seen before. This talk examines those categories and how we can harden our systems against these categories of events, which include unforeseen hard capacity limits, cascading failures, hidden system dependencies, and more.

## Complexity: The Crucial Ingredient in Your Kitchen

Software engineering is basically rocket science, so it comes as no surprise that we can learn a lot from that industry. For example, the Challenger explosion in 1986 is a fascinating subject for study. The details of the incident are well documented from a variety of angles (engineering, political, sociotechnical, ethnographical, etc) providing a rich dataset. Highlighting a few examples from this, we can empathize with the architecture considerations and organizational issues that engineers faced at NASA during that time. There are strong, informative parallels between the events that led up to that tragic incident and how software engineers think about reliability today. As Churchill allegedly quipped, "Never let a good crisis go to waste."


CEO/Founder of Verica.io. Previously an engineering manager for the Traffic Engineering Team and the Chaos Engineering Team at Netflix. As an executive manager and senior architect, Casey has managed teams to tackle Big Data, architect solutions to difficult problems, and train others to do the same. He finds opportunities to leverage his experience with distributed systems, artificial intelligence, translating novel algorithms and academia into working models, and selling a vision of the possible to clients and colleagues alike. For fun, Casey models human behavior using personality profiles in Ruby, Erlang, Elixir, Prolog, Scala, and other languages. He speaks frequently on the topics of Chaos Engineering and Complexity.
